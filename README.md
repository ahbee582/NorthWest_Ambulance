# 🚑 North West Ambulance Service Data Analysis

This repository contains a Power BI project for analysing ambulance service data from the **North West Ambulance Service (NWAS)**. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights from service data such as response times, incident locations, call volumes, and performance trends using a CSV dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

The data visualisation and analysis in this project are intended to:
- Understand call demand patterns (e.g., by time, location, type)
- Evaluate response time performance
- Identify areas with high incident density
- Support data-driven decision making in emergency service planning

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `NWAS_Data.csv` – The raw dataset used for the analysis (not included if confidential)
- `NWAS_PowerBI_Report.pbix` – The Power BI report file
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – For data transformation, analysis, and visualisation
- **Microsoft Excel / Power Query** – (Optional) For initial data cleaning
- **CSV file** – Main data source

## 📌 Key Insights (example placeholders)

- Most ambulance calls occur during weekends and late evenings.
- Category 1 response times meet the national target 87% of the time.
- Central Manchester and Liverpool show the highest call densities.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Incorporate demographic or weather data for deeper insights.
- Automate data refresh for real-time dashboards.
- Compare performance with other ambulance trusts for benchmarking.
